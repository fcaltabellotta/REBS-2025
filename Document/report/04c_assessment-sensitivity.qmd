## Characterizing uncertainty
### Sensitivity Analyses {#sec-assmt-sens}
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model sensitivity to alternative data treatment and model specifications.

#### Data treatment sensitivities
Data treatments explored were as follows:

- Treatment of abundance indiecs 
	  1. 2015 dockside survey
    2. 2015 dockside survey, no extra variance estimated
  	3. No extra variance on private boat index
  	
  	- Data weighting
  	11. No data-weighting
  	12. Dirichlet data-weighting
  	13. McAllister-Ianelli data weighting

- Other
  	14. 2015 removal history
  	
Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Table . Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure . Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures  and .

#### Model Specification Sensitivities {#senstivities}
Model specifications looked at the estimation of individual and combinations of life history parameters, the estimation of recruitment, and the treatment of fecundity and selectivity. All scenarios match the reference model specifications in all other aspects unless otherwise stated.

- Life history estimation
	- Natural mortality ($M$)
		1. Fix natural mortality at the value used in the 2013 assessment ($M$ = 0.0420 yr^-1)
		2. Estimate natural mortality for both sexes
		3. Estimate natural mortality using Lorenzen's method
	
	- Growth parameters
	 	6. Fix growth parameters estimated externally: males ($L_{\infty}$ = 56.69 cm; $k$ = 0.08; $L_at_Amin$ = 0.32 cm) and females $L_{\infty}$ = 59.03 cm; $k$ = 0.07; $L_at_Amin$ = 0 cm)
	
	- Reproductive Biology
	 	10. Use biological maturity ogive
	 	11. Use functional maturity ogive
	 	12. Fecundity proportional to weight

	- Recruitment estimation
	 	13. No recruitment estimation
	 	14. Estimate recruitment for all years in the model
 
 Other
 
Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Table . Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure . Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures  and . None of the sensitivities indicated an overfished stock.
 
### Likelihood Profiles


### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data up through minus 5 years. Retrospective spawning output (Figure ) and relatives stock status (Figure ) estimates show a generally consistent pattern in population scale and trend, within the error of the reference model. All models show the population increasing. This results in a stock status in the precautionary zone over the 5 year consideration. The Mohn's rho evaluation of the degree of retrospective pattern in given in Table  and shown in Figure . The relative error in the data peels are below significant levels. 


### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

There are no major unresolved problems in the stock assessment, but there are many sources of uncertainty. Natural mortality remains a large source of uncertainty. The estimation of growth also required fixing certain parameters, leading to an underestimation of uncertainty in the model. The stock-recruit relationship is assumed to be a Beverton-Holt relationship with a fixed steepness of 0.72. Large uncertainty was shown if the nature of this relationship varies either deterministically or over time. The full time series of recruitment deviations were not informed, which creates some historical and contemporary uncertainty. Likewise, all life history values are assumed constant, so any time-varying issues that are directional could create more uncertainty.
